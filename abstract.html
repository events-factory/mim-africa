                  GENERAL INFORMATION FOR ORAL PRESENTERS AND MODERATORS
                </h3>
                <p><b>Presentation Development and Slide Submission</b></p>

                <p>
                  <b>Presentation Length:</b> In general, Oral abstract
                  presenters are asked to prepare an 8-minute presentation. An
                  optimal 8-minute presentation has 8 content slides not
                  including the 1 title slide provided. The session moderators
                  will cut off presentations longer than 8 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Presentation Contents:</b> Refer to the Guidelines for
                  Presentation Development below for slide format and details on
                  content to be included or excluded in presentations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b> Slide Submission:</b> The final version of the
                  presentation slides must be submitted in the Speaker Ready
                  Room at MIM (refer to the conference program for location) 24
                  hours before the start of the session. The presentation you
                  upload in the Speaker Ready Room will be projected in the
                  session room from a central location, not from a laptop at the
                  podium. Bring your notes with you, as there is no notes
                  preview at the podium for your presentation.
                </p>
                <p><b>Check-In on Session Day </b></p>
                <p>
                  Presenters and moderators should check in at the front of the
                  session room (near the podium) 10 minutes before the start of
                  the session. The first group of presenters will then be seated
                  on the stage. Following the first segment, the second group
                  will be seated on the stage.
                </p>
                <p><b>Session Flow </b></p>
                <p>
                  Oral sessions generally have 6 presentations. Many attendees
                  move from session to session; THEREFORE, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT
                  EACH PRESENTATION IS KEPT TO TIME. Before the session begins,
                  Presenter Group 1 and the Oral Session Moderators take the
                  stage. Regardless of the number of presentations, sessions
                  will follow the same general flow:

                <b>Slide Format </b>
                <p>
                  <b>Slide Template:</b> In case you will not use your
                  organization slide template, you are welcome to use the MIM
                  Slide Template (uploaded on the website).
                </p>

                  <b>Format:</b> When preparing your presentation, note that
                  high-definition (HD) projectors will be used for all MIM

                  your slides (aspect ratio 16:9; resolution 1920 x 1080).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Font Size:</b> For content slides, it is generally
                  recommended to have a font size of 26 to 32 (based on Arial
                  font) for text. Details should be visible from the back of a
                  large ballroom (avoid overly detailed figures or large blocks

                  to questions from attendees.

                <p>
                  The suggested size for posters is A1 PORTRAIT or 59.5 cm
                  (width) x 84.1 cm (height) so attendees can see the poster at
                  least 3 meters away.
                </p>
                <p>All posters should be printed in poster materials only.</p>
                <p>
                  The face of the poster board is covered with Velcro-receptive
                  fabric. Pushpins will be provided to hang posters. Posters
                  will be set up on the day before.
