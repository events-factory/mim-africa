                      <p>
                        In April, Rwanda experiences its rainy season, but
                        temperatures remain generally warm. The average daily
                        temperature in Kigali is 21°C (70°F). It’s best to dress
                        in light layers with breathable fabrics. Evenings might
                        be cooler, so consider bringing a light sweater or
                        jacket. Don’t forget to wear a hat, sunglasses, and pack
                        sunscreen to protect against the sun.
