                <h4>Conference Overview</h4>
                <p>
                  The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) Society 8th
                  Pan-African Malaria Conference (PAMC), organized by the
                  Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) Society in
                  collaboration with the Ministry of Health-Rwanda and the
                  Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC), will take place from April
                  21-27, 2024, in Kigali-Rwanda. This conference will convene
                  global experts to discuss the latest achievements, research
                  and innovations in malaria prevention and treatment. The
                  conference theme, 'Grassroots Mobilization to End Malaria:
                  Invest, Innovate & Integrate,' highlights the significance of
                  grassroots efforts, innovation, and research in developing new
                  tools and technologies for malaria control. The conference
                  will also provide a platform for researchers, policymakers,
                  and stakeholders to share experiences and insights on
                  addressing Malaria as a critical public health concern.
                </p>

                  Malaria is a severe health challenge in Africa. According to
                  the
                  <a
                    href="https://www.afro.who.int/publications/world-malaria-report-2023"
                    class="blue"
                    ><b>WHO World Malaria Report 2023</b></a
                  >
                  , the WHO African Region accounted for 93.6% of malaria cases
                  and 95.4% of malaria deaths globally in 2022. The report also
                  highlights that 78.1% of fatalities are from children aged
                  under the ages of five. At the heart of the fight against
                  malaria lies the need for grassroots mobilization. Community
                  engagement is pivotal in raising awareness, promoting
                  preventive measures, and ensuring early diagnosis and
                  treatment.

                <p>
                  The MIM Society 8th Pan-African Malaria conference will
                  highlight successful community-based initiatives and
                  innovative in the fight against malaria. The conference will
                  also focus on research that remain to be the cornerstone of
                  effective malaria control. It will celebrate breakthroughs in
                  malaria research while encouraging collaboration between
                  scientists, institutions, sectors, and policymakers.

                  World Malaria Day 2024 amid the 8th PAMC
                </h4>
                <p>
                  World Malaria Day is celebrated annually on April 25th to
                  raise awareness about the global burden of malaria and amplify
                  efforts to combat the disease. Malaria is a preventable
                  illness, that requires the collaboration of various
                  stakeholders to defeat and the society at large to eliminate
                  it. The MIM Society 8th Pan-African Malaria Conference (PAMC)
                  is scheduled to take place in Rwanda from April 21-27, 2024,
                  coinciding with World Malaria Day. This unique coincidence
                  provides an opportunity for stakeholders to come together to
                  discuss the global status of malaria and strategize better
                  ways to combat its prevalence in the continent. The conference
                  will play a significant role in promoting scientific advances
                  to reduce the global burden of malaria, emphasizing the
                  importance of continued investment in malaria prevention and
                  control, while also paying tribute to the efforts of
                  researchers and healthcare professionals in the fight against
                  malaria.

                <p>
                  The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is a global
                  alliance of citizens, institutions, funding partners and
                  constituents having a shared goal of fostering scientific
                  research capacity in Africa to defeat and eradicate malaria in
                  the continent. The MIM was launched in 1997 following the
                  first Pan-African Malaria Conference in Dakar, Senegal, that
                  participated prominent malaria scientists, representatives
                  from the World Health Organization (WHO), and funding
                  organizations from all over the world. The conference
                  identified important research priorities for future malaria
                  research. Since its establishment, the MIM has been
                  instrumental in strengthening research capacity in Africa,
                  increasing international cooperation and communication, and
                  utilization of research findings to inform malaria prevention,
                  treatment, and control focused on developing sustainable
                  malaria research capacity in Africa.

                <p>
                  Over the past few years, the MIM organized Pan African Malaria
                  Conferences in different parts of Africa including, Senegal,
                  South Africa, Tanzania, Cameroon, and Kenya. The 8th edition
                  of the Pan African Malaria Conference is scheduled to take
                  place in Kigali, Rwanda from April 21-27, 2024. The MIM
                  Society organizes this conference in collaboration with the
                  Ministry of Health, Rwanda and the Rwanda Biomedical Center
                  with the mission of bringing key stakeholders together to
                  reaffirm collective commitment to ending malaria in Africa by
                  unlocking new solutions and innovations. <br />To learn more

                <h4 class="margin_bottom">Rwanda: Malaria control efforts</h4>
                <p>
                  Rwanda's success in malaria control is nothing short of
                  remarkable. Over the past two decades, the country has made
                  significant strides in reducing malaria-related morbidity and
                  mortality. Through robust surveillance, evidence-based vector
                  control interventions deployment, and community engagement,
                  Rwanda has achieved impressive results. The decline in malaria
                  incidence and deaths from the disease is a testament to the
                  effectiveness of the country's intervention. Malaria incidence
                  per 1,000 reduced from 409 in 2016/17 to 47 in 2022/23 in the
                  country. Effective strategies and programs have contributed to
                  this progress in malaria control in Rwanda.

                  aims at effectively protecting at least 85% of the at-risk
                  population in Rwanda with preventative interventions. Putting
                  in place effective surveillance, reporting, coordination, and
                  collaboration systems as well as fast tracking testing and
                  treatments across the country have also played a pivotal role
                  in the success of malaria control in the country. At the
                  center of Rwanda's success also exists strong leadership
                  support, and grassroots mobilization, with communities being
                  involved in malaria prevention campaigns, bed net
                  distribution, and early diagnosis.

                  with at least 55% reduction in malaria case incidence.
                  However, this success story is not just about numbers; it's
                  about lives saved and families protected.

            Together with his group they have published a Nature’s paper on
            their discovery pooling testing strategy
            (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2885-5 ) which shows a
            cost-saving approach for better use of SARS-CoV-2 limited testing
            resources. He is principal investigator of a national prospective
            cohort study aiming at assessing COVID-19 vaccines immune response
            in Rwandan population. He also serves as a board member of
